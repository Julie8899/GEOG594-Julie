*My definition of Big Data*

Based on my understanding, big data means that the volume of data generation is explosion because data can be generated fast. It is harder for us to store and use data. Big data consists of structure and unstructured data. Data users give up their data which is also their privacy to exchange free and convenient. Big data provides a chance for some companies to predict and analyze their customer’s behavior. For example, when I searched one product in google, all of sudden, I can see lots of companies’ advertisements about same products in Youtube, Facebook, Instagram and so on. The feature of big data should include value, veracity, velocity, variability, variety, volume and volatility.
